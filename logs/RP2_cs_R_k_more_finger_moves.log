# Results of computations:
#
# Both for
# k=2 and k=3,
# the relation [t_k, d^(-1)*t_k*d]
# (i.e. w = d in [t_k, w^(-1)*t_k*w])
# will abelianize the group of RP^2 # R_k
#
# for k=4 the group of the RP^2-knot is NOT abelianized by relation [t_k, d^(-1)*t_k*d]
# quotient is "S3"
#
# for k=5 the group of the RP^2-knot IS abelianized by relation [t_k, d^(-1)*t_k*d]
# for k=6 the group of the RP^2-knot IS abelianized by relation [t_k, d^(-1)*t_k*d]

# [for k=7 not enough memory on Samsung laptop]
# on MPIM metis with
